Point charge model
================================================
The BDF supports the calculation of atomic charges in the MM region as point charge input. The point charge is given as input to the ``$BDFTASK.extcharge`` file
with the same name as the calculation task as input, in the following format:

.. code-block:: bdf

  $COMPASS

The point charge input file (file name h2o.extcharge) is as followsï¼š

.. code-block:: bdf

    External charge, Point charge   #The first line is the title and description line
    6                               #The number of point charges to enter

The default input format for point charges is: atomic label, charge, and coordinates (x\  y\  z); the coordinates are in angstroms by default. Coordinate input
units can also be be Bohr, and the input format is as follows


.. code-block:: bdf

    External charge, Point charge   # title line
    6    Bohr                       # Unit: Bohr  
    C1     -0.732879     0.000000     5.000000     0.114039
